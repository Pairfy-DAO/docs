# DAO

Pairfy is a decentralized autonomous organization with a democratic constitutional model.
This means it has a fundamental document containing principles and rules for the proper management of the decentralized organization.

Before the document is established, DAO members debate its content. As a result of this debate, a draft is created and put to a vote.
If the positive votes exceed the 95% threshold, it becomes the DAO's constitutional document.

Any DAO member with voting power > 1 can create a request for:

- **Amendments**: Refer to formal changes made to the constitution, such as the addition, modification, or deletion of provisions.

The Discord channel moderator will initiate a 7-day poll tagging @everyone to determine whether there is interest in further discussing the proposed amendment.
If the majority votes yes, a 7-day debate period will follow.

After the debate, a second 7-day poll will be conducted to let @everyone decide whether the amendment should proceed to an on-chain vote.
::: info
The constitucional document remains on GITHUB for versioning auditing.
